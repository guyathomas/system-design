Scalability

Harvard web development
- Vertical scaling
	- increasing the power of resources
	- i.e. increased HDD size or ram
	- faces real world constraints such as an upper limit on processor speed. can also be very costly
- Horizontal scaling
	- add more machines or HDD's to the system
	- Can use a load balancer (which will have the public IP) to route the requests to the horizontally scaled servers
		- Send based on load, round robin, origin, etc...
- CDN's for static files
