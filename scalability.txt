Scalability

Harvard web development
- Vertical scaling
	- increasing the power of resources
	- i.e. increased HDD size or ram
	- faces real world constraints such as an upper limit on processor speed. can also be very costly
- Horizontal scaling
	- add more machines or HDD's to the system
	- Can use a load balancer (which will have the public IP) to route the requests to the horizontally scaled servers
		- Send based on load, round robin, origin, etc...
			- Problems / gotchyas
				- All systems need to be identical ()
				- Depending on the load balancing technique
					- Round robin
						- Some servers may get uneven load if there are power users.
						- Might get unlucky because some server may get it's requests cached by the browser where as another one's may not
						- Sessions are unique to each machine, so having multiple machines can mean that each machine has it's own unique session (and a user may have to log in multiple times, add items to cart multiple times, etc...)
				- Possible to have a shared HDD for all servers that stores the session state for each client
- CDN's for static files
